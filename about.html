<h1>NICE TO MEET YOU</h1>

Hi there-- welcome to my site!
<br><br>
My name is Josh, and I am a 2020 graduate of the University of Wisconsin Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department. Weather and aviation have long been passions of mine, and I hope to share these loves with others while inspiring curiousity about the natural processes of our world.
<br><br>
My time in the airline industry as a frontline customer service employee has left a significant impact on my desired career path. I have found my home in the airlines, and look forward to returning to them in the future. Working with and serving others has always been a rewarding experience, and I look forward to applying my experience as I continue to serve society. Of particular interest are positions in airline operations, airline meteorology, and similar positions with the opportunity to work in an educational or public safety capacity.
